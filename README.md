Introducing Jarvis, your personal speech-activated assistant! Our goal is to deliver a cutting-edge bot that springs to life whenever you say "Jarvis", ready to answer your questions and help you get things done. With Jarvis, you can ask questions using your voice, and receive answers via text-to-speech. We're dedicated to providing a seamless and intuitive experience, so you can get the information you need quickly and easily. Whether you're looking for the latest news, checking the weather, or just need a little help with your daily routine, Jarvis is here to assist you every step of the way.

## Features <img src="./static/microphone_icon.png" alt="microphone icon" width="25" height="25">

- Wake-up Word: Jarvis will be activated by a specific wake-up word, such as "Jarvis," making it easy to start asking questions.
- Speech Recognition: Our bot will use advanced speech recognition technology to accurately transcribe spoken language into text.
- Natural Language Processing: Jarvis will be equipped with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, allowing it to understand and interpret user questions in a more human-like way.
- Text-to-Speech: Answers from Jarvis will be converted into speech and played back to the user, making it easy to get information without having to read on a screen.
- Question and Answer: Jarvis will be able to answer a wide range of questions, from general knowledge to specific topics, providing users with the information they need quickly and easily.

## Roadmap <img src="./static/microphone_icon.png" alt="microphone icon" width="25" height="25">

- Dynamic Listening: Add a feature where the bot stops listening based on whether the user is speaking or not, rather than a static time limit. This can help to improve the user experience by making it more responsive and natural.

- Persona Customization: Allow users to modify the persona of Jarvis to better suit their needs, such as personal assistant, artist, programmer, or other types of virtual assistants. This can help users to feel more comfortable interacting with the bot and create a more personalized experience.

- Browser Control: Enable Jarvis to have control of the browser, allowing it to open new tabs or windows as necessary to display articles or other information requested by the user.

- Multi-Instance Support: Allow multiple instances of Jarvis to run simultaneously, making it possible for users to have different assistants for different purposes or in different locations.

- Conversation History: Enable Jarvis to save previous conversations and allow users to continue where they left off. This can help users to keep track of their interactions with the bot and provide a more seamless experience.

- Third-Party Integration: Allow Jarvis to integrate with other third-party services, such as social media or email, to provide more comprehensive assistance.
